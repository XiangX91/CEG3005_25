Annual estimates of the number of entries/exits and interchanges at each station in Great Britain. These estimates are based primarily on ticket sales and are produced by Steer on behalf of ORR. For details on how these statistics are compiled, please see our Estimates of station usage quality and methodology report. We have also produced a list of frequently asked questions. For any information on revisions, please see our Revisions log.
